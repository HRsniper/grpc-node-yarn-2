## Insomnia

The `Insomnia.json` file contains the **gRPC**/_HTTP2_ requests for [_Insomnia_](https://insomnia.rest/download/).

## Importing `Insomnia.json` into _Insomnia_

Click `Create â–¼`, and in `IMPORT FROM`, click `File`, select the `Insomnia.json` path, click on it, and click `Import`.

A `Collection` will be created with the name _gRPC_, click on it and it will open all the requests that are in the `Insomnia.json` file.
